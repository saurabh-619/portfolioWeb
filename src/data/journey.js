Got serious about studies in class 9th. Until then didn't know a squat about coding. I got 97% in SSC and 90% in HSC and got admitted to PCCOE for Computer Engineering Degree.",

      "Currently, I am a Second Year, Computer Engineering undergrad in PCCOE. In the first year of engineering, I'd barely passed the subjects related to Computer. I used to find C, C++ languages very difficult to understand and would love to read all subject but related to computer. So in nutshell, I didn't learn anything about coding in the very First year of engineering.",

So here my Web journey got started. I learned HTML, CSS, SASS, JS for Front-End, and Nodejs, Mongo Db for Back-End. This took me like 4-5 months. Those were tough months, reading through documents, StackOverflow for errors. But still, I managed to create some interesting projects. I learned React Js which was a major bump in Design and speed of coding.",

      "In scariest and most boring days of Quarantine, I started leaning App development. But deciding the platform whether Java, Kotlin, React Native, and Flutter to use was a difficult job. So I watched some discussions based on the same and came to the decision that Flutter would be the one. Learning Flutter was again a challenge as it was launched pretty recently, then. I created some projects, creating UI was fairly easy job being from a Web background and also learning Dart wasn't that much tough as I thought it was a combination of Java and JS.",
